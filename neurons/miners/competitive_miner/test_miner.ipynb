We kicked things off with the OnePlus 13, and followed it up with Samsung\\'s latest Galaxy S25 series of handsets, which offer notable improvements over their predecessors. There\\'s also a lot more AI to come as manufacturers showcase new innovations at the Mobile World Congress in March. We\\'ll be rigorously testing and reviewing every new phone to give you the best, most relevant buying advice.\\nAlso: The best 5G phones: Expert tested\\nWhat is the best smartphone right now?\\nAfter extensive testing of dozens of devices, our pick for the best phone overall is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, thanks to its immersive and vibrant display, reliable battery life, and wealth of special features, some of which are powered by the company\\'s latest generative AI model. The flagship iPhone 16 Pro Max is a close second, with a thinner and larger design, a Camera Control key for precision capturing, and a suite of Apple Intelligence features that continue to improve.\\nOf course, our pick for the best phone overall may not be the best for you. But no matter which option on this list you decide to invest in, expect it to be high-performing, have a display that gets bright enough to use outdoors, and field a camera system that will fulfill most, if not all, your photography needs.\\nBest phones of 2025\\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, the most premium of the three flagship S phones of 2025, is the best handset you can buy from the brand. The new Galaxy AI model embedded in the device brings a bevy of generative AI capabilities, including real-time phone call translations, multi-app AI voice prompts, enhanced photo and video editing, and a new AI Select tool that offers contextual shortcuts based on what you hover over.\\nLike its predecessor, the S24 Ultra, the S25 Ultra is built with a large 6.9-inch AMOLED and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. Although the price is still fairly inaccessible at $1,299, the phone\\'s upgrades make it well worth it for users holding onto three to four-year-old devices. It helps that the S25 Ultra is made of a lightweight yet durable titanium frame and features Corning\\'s new Gorilla Armor 2.\\nReview: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\\nThe S25 Ultra retains last year\\'s anti-reflection screen which, when paired with the larger cooling chamber, makes it a fantastic multimedia device -- whether gaming or watching movies. Under the hood, the S25 Ultra includes an upgraded Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset for improved graphics and AI features and 12GB of RAM.\\nAs for the new camera system, the big upgrade comes in the form of a 50MP ultrawide lens that produces greater detail and vividness when capturing both landscape and macro shots. You\\'ll just have to live with the fact that the S Pen no longer supports Bluetooth gestures, which previously allowed users to snap with a click of the stylus key.\\nAlso: Best password managers\\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto with 5x zoom, 10MP telephoto with 3x zoom | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 5,000mAh\\nThe latest iPhone 16 Pro Max offers everything a premium flagship smartphone should, including a brilliant 6.9-inch AMOLED display for all the media consumption -- and mobile productivity, of course. The 2024 model also looks and feels different than any prior Pro Max devices due to its thinner bezels, larger screen, and addition of the Camera Control button, a physical switch that lets you quickly open the camera and snap photos without ever touching the screen.\\nZDNET Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner tried the touch-capacitive feature and suggested that \"it\\'s going to be super handy for people who take a ton of photos with the iPhone.\" Another major feature of the iPhone 16 Pro Max is the new A18 Pro chip, which Apple claims should yield significantly faster and more efficient AI processing.\\nWith the upcoming public release of Apple Intelligence, the brand\\'s suite of AI tools and features that includes image generation, a more capable Siri, and notification summaries, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is the most future-proof device yet.\\nReview: iPhone 16 Pro Max\\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max also features two new camera features: the ability to record 4K at 120 frames per second, which allows you to edit and produce slow-motion video without losing much detail, and Audio Mix, which distinguishes and amplifies specific waveforms to make voices sound clearer.\\nAn improved battery life, which Apple rates at 33 hours of video playback versus last year\\'s 29 hours, rounds out the phone\\'s biggest upgrades. The iPhone 16 Pro Max also supports 25W wireless charging now via a compatible MagSafe adapter. Given all the upgrades, Apple continues to charge $1,199 for its most premium iPhone model, with 256GB of storage at the base level.\\nAlso: Best password manager for iPhone\\niPhone 16 Pro Max tech specs: Processor: A18 Pro | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 48MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 12MP telephoto (2x), 12MP telephoto (5x) | Front camera: 12MP\\nWhen it comes to camera performance, you really can\\'t go wrong with any of the flagship devices from the big three (Apple, Samsung, and Google). Depending on your preference for color temperature and feature set, you may lean towards one manufacturer over the other.\\nBut more often than not, Google\\'s Pixel camera system satisfies most users, and the latest Pixel 9 Pro (and Pro XL) remains a champion for instant capturing and post-processing.\\nBoth sizes of the latest model feature a reliable triple lens setup, with a 50MP primary lens, a 48MP ultrawide, and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens for far-distance shots. They\\'re backed by numerous software features like Google\\'s Super Res Zoom (for up to 30x zoom photos), 8K video upscaling, and a new Add Me feature that lets you snap and merge two photos so everyone can be in the same shot.\\nReview: Google Pixel 9 Pro XL\\nThere\\'s also a new 42MP selfie camera that\\'s both sharper and captures a wider FOV than last year\\'s 10.8MP sensor. That should play well with group selfies and scenic shots.\\nAgain, real-time capturing is only half the battle with mobile photography; there\\'s also post-processing and the flexibility of devices with editing and tweaking subjects around. In that regard, the Pixel 9 Pro, powered by a new Tensor G4 chipset, may just have the most flexible and creative photo toolbox on the market, with AI features like Magic Editor, Photo Unblur, and Best Take that can turn any bad photo into a good one.\\nAll in all, the Pixel 9 Pro has one of the most versatile camera systems on the market, with an output that\\'s balanced in color and generally satisfying to look at.\\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL tech specs: Processor: Google Tensor G4 | Display size: 6.3 and 6.7 inches | Storage options: 128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide, 48MP telephoto | Front camera: 42MP | Battery: 4,700/5,060mAh\\nThe best cheap phone you can buy today is the CMF Phone 1. Starting at $239, the Phone 1 has several features going for it that put it above devices that cost hundreds of dollars more, such as the ability to manually replace the back cover, screw in accessories (including a kickstand, wallet slot, and more), and insert a MicroSD card for expanded storage.\\nReview: CMF Phone 1\\nYou would think that a $200 phone would settle on essential specs like display quality, battery life, and software, but those exact three aspects score high marks for the Phone 1. The 2,000-nit display gets bright enough to use comfortably outdoors, the 5,000mAh battery will hold up for most users, and Nothing\\'s interpretation of Android is thoughtful, short on bloatware, and full of unique widgets.\\nOf course, you\\'ll have to settle with something when you\\'re paying around $200 for a phone. In the case of the Phone 1, that comes in the form of a Dimensity 7300 5G processor that\\'s just good enough for browsing and social media but less so for extended gaming, a camera system that\\'s not as capable in low-light environments, and a lack of network band support that makes the phone unusable if you\\'re on Verizon.\\nCMF Phone 1 by Nothing tech specs: Display size: 6.67 inches | Display type: AMOLED | Resolution: 2780 x 1264 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Battery life: 5,500mAh | RAM: Up to 16GB | Storage: Up to 256GB | Rear camera: 50MP Sony IMX890 main, 8MP ultra-wide, 2MP macro | Front camera: 16MP | Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\\nOnePlus has had its ups and downs over the past four years, pivoting from value-driven smartphones to ultra-premium and back. In 2025, the company is doubling-down on the high-end market with the OnePlus 13, all while undercutting the likes of Apple and Samsung.\\nThe OnePlus 13 starts at $899, which is cheaper than its closest (current) competitors, the $999 Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus and Google Pixel 9 Pro. Here\\'s everything you get for the price: a large 6.8-inch, 120Hz AMOLED, a 6,000mAh battery, a triple camera setup with a competent 50MP main lens at the helm, the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and more. Again: $899, and that\\'s before the $100 discount when you trade in any phone in any condition to OnePlus. Take advantage of that.\\nReview: OnePlus 13\\nPutting the value aspect aside, the OnePlus 13 shines with its charging speed, something you\\'ll quickly take for granted once you realize that phones don\\'t have to sit by an outlet for two hours every day. The phone\\'s 80W wired charging can power it from 0% to 50% within 10 minutes. A full charge takes less than 30 minutes.\\nJust as impressive is the OnePlus 13\\'s IP69 rating, which laps its predecessor, the OnePlus 12, in water resistance. By IP69 standards, the new phone can withstand high-pressure, high-temperature water jets and humidity changes. In other words, leaving the device in a washer and dryer, or even dropping it in a pot of boiling soup, won\\'t damage it.\\nOnePlus 13 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display size: 6.8 inches | Storage options: Up to 512GB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto | Front camera: 32MP | Battery: 6,000mAh\\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 6, unveiled at Samsung Unpacked last July, packs a ton of character and features into a tiny clamshell that pays homage to flip phones of the past.\\nShape-shifting displays aside, the Z Flip 6 is very similar to the standard Samsung Galaxy S-series flagship, with a large 6.7-inch AMOLED panel that\\'s crisp and bright, up to 512GB of storage for those high-resolution pictures and videos, and a healthy 4,000mAh battery powering it all -- an upgrade from the Z Flip 5. There\\'s also now a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and the first vapor cooling chamber ever on a Z Flip device, both of which should make the phone run more efficiently, reducing battery drainage. The phone is thinner and lighter than previous models, too.\\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6\\nThe Z Flip 6\\'s camera system gets a nice boost, too, with an improved 50MP main sensor and 12MP ultra-wide. You\\'ll also find a new AI-powered Auto Zoom feature, which automatically detects how many people are in a frame, as well as potential background objects the user may want to be kept in the shot, and repositions digitally.\\nThe Z Flip 6 also includes some fun new features for the Flex Window, or outer display of the flip phone, including interactive wallpapers, suggested replies to text messages, and a new Interpreter Mode for live translations.\\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Main display: 6.7 inches | Cover display: 3.4 inches | RAM/Storage: 12GB RAM with 256GB/512GB internal options | Cameras: 50MP wide angle, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP selfie | Battery: 4,000mAh\\nWhile the OnePlus Open is arguably the better-equipped device, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the best foldable phone going into the rest of 2025, thanks to its user-friendly form factor and market-leading camera system. Google took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, opting for a shorter and wider panel than Samsung\\'s taller approach.\\nReview: Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold\\nNaturally, all the content you\\'re used to consuming, like video streaming and social media, is portrayed in a familiar manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn\\'t match its Pixel Pro sibling spec-for-spec, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold truly shines and more than makes up for the \"inferior\" camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature.\\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold also succeeds the previous model with a more capable Google Tensor G4 chipset; Google AI features like Pixel Screenshots, Reimagine, and Gemini Live; and a lighter form factor for a more comfortable user experience. All in all, Google modified nearly all the right places with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, enough to make it a sleeper hit that is now at the top of our ranking list.\\nGoogle Pixel 9 Fold tech specs: Processor: Google Tensor G4 | Display sizes: 6.3-inch exterior and 8-inch interior | Storage options: 256GB or 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide, 10.8MP ultrawide, 10.8MP telephoto | Front cameras: 10MP front | Battery: 4,650mAh\\nTop smartphones compared\\nOur pick for the best phone overall is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It features everything you could want from a smartphone, including a large display, four cameras that can shoot 200MP photos and 8K video, up to 1TB of storage, a built-in S Pen for writing and drawing, and a 5,000mAh battery powering the system. Here\\'s how the S24 Ultra fares with the rest of our top picks.\\nBest phone model | Price | Storage | Screen size | Battery size | Processor |\\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | $1,299 | Up to 1TB | 6.9 inches | 5,000mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy |\\niPhone 16 Pro Max | $1,199 | Up to 1TB | 6.9 inches | 4,323mAh (est.) | A18 Pro Bionic |\\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL | $1,199 | Up to 1TB | 6.7 inches | 5,060mAh | Google Tensor G4 |\\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold | $1,799 | Up to 512GB | 6.3 inches and 8 inches | 4,650mAh | Google Tensor G4 |\\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 | $1,220 | Up to 512GB | 6.7 inches | 4,000mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 |\\nCMF Phone 1 | $259 | Up to 256GB | 6.67 inches | 5,000mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 |\\nOnePlus 13 | $899 | Up to 512GB | 6.8 inches | 6,000mAh | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite |\\nWhich is the right phone for you?\\nChoosing a phone can be daunting. But having a list of your must-have features can go a long way toward narrowing down your options. If you\\'re a mobile professional or travel a lot for work, you\\'ll want to choose a phone that can provide you with at least a full day of use on a full battery and both LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity.\\nIf you\\'re looking for your teen\\'s first smartphone, a budget-friendly and less feature-heavy option may be better to prevent overspending and misuse. And if you\\'re a content creator or other creative professional, you\\'ll want a phone with an excellent front and rear camera to capture photos and videos for your social media feed.\\nChoose this best phone... | If you want... |\\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | A no-compromise smartphone that virtually any type of user can take advantage of. It\\'s the only 2025 smartphone with a built-in stylus. |\\niPhone 16 Pro Max | The best iPhone money can buy. It has a large screen, the longest-lasting battery out of all the models, and a toolbox of a camera system. |\\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL | A flagship camera experience at your fingertips. The Pixel 9 Pro XL differentiates itself with a slew of AI-powered and the best selfie camera on the market. |\\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold | The best phone-to-tablet foldable that money can buy today. And if you\\'re a power user, the multitasking and AI features will serve you especially well. |\\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 | A flip-style foldable that\\'s both compact and performant. With a large 3.4-inch external display and improved battery life, this is the foldable to buy for most people. |\\nCMF Phone 1 | A more budget-friendly smartphone that doesn\\'t compromise on performance and software experience. The CMF Phone 1 also has a unique removable back cover that opens up a world of 3D-printed customizations. |\\nOnePlus 13 | A phone that lasts long and charges from 0% to 100% in just 30 minutes. The OnePlus 13 is quietly good value, too, starting at $899. |\\nAndroid vs iOS: How to decide\\nAndroid:\\nGoogle\\'s operating system has always been about personalization, app freedom, and flexible use cases. For example, dozens of Android manufacturers launch phones annually, while iOS runs only on Apple\\'s iPhone, which releases two models yearly. Naturally, there are more Android app developers, niche software and services, and form factors that go beyond the glass slab.\\nPros:\\n- Customization: While the latest iPhone software, iOS 18, is the most customizable version yet, Android is still ahead in modifying settings, looks and appearance, and more. You can adjust settings on a per-app basis, install third-party launchers, icon packs, and other services, and even tweak system animations to make the operating system faster.\\n- App variety: According to AppExperts, there are over 3.5 million Android apps on the Google Play Store and more than 1.8 million apps on the iOS App Store. That\\'s a big difference in volume that ultimately impacts users who desire more niche and specific apps for work and play. For example, while both platforms will carry services like WhatsApp and Instagram, Android usually has the upper hand with companion apps for consumer products, unreleased APKs, and more. There\\'s also free access to sideload apps from third-party stores -- that process is exclusive to European users as far as iOS is concerned.\\n- Price and availability: Both Android and iOS are offered across the mid-to-high price tiers, but the former goes a step further with options that cater to budget-oriented shoppers. If you\\'re shopping for a smartphone for less than $300, unless you\\'re willing to buy a second-hand iPhone that\\'s already a few generations old, Android handsets are your best option. Android phones also come in foldable form factors, from clamshell-style devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 to bookstyle ones like the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\\nCons:\\n- Security and privacy: The abundance of Android phones and app makers means there are more opportunities for hackers and data thieves to access your personal information and/or install malware. How these attacks are prevented and managed also varies across manufacturers, with some OEMs like Google doing a better job than others like Xiaomi.\\n- Inconsistency with quality: Like security and privacy, you must always consider which Android maker you\\'re buying a phone from and what it offers across different price ranges. Larger legacy brands like Samsung have a greater reputation for quality assurance and value. In contrast, smaller, newer brands like Nothing and OnePlus must prove themselves, sometimes taking risks that backfire in the process.\\niOS:\\nThe iPhone\\'s operating system remains one of the most robust and closed-in on the market, with unique features that only amplify the Apple hardware experience. Whether you\\'re using an older or newer iPhone, iOS offers superior feature parity across generations than Android, with extended software support being one of its biggest benefits.\\nPros:\\n- Exclusive, ecosystem-based services: Strength in numbers is the name of the game for iOS, with the operating system notorious for its exclusive apps and services, such as iMessage and FaceTime, which make switching away from the iPhone more difficult than it should be. It helps that Apple has surrounded the iPhone with hardware and software that work harmoniously with iOS, including AirDropping files into a MacBook, pulling health data from an Apple Watch, and, just recently, supporting hearing aid tests via AirPods Pro 2.\\n- Quality of apps: Beyond the first-party apps, U.S. developers often spend more time creating and optimizing iOS apps than Android apps due to the percentage of users. Naturally, services like Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok function more fluidly on iOS than on Android.\\n- Longevity: When you buy a new iPhone, expect upwards of seven years of software support. While Android makers like Google and Samsung have begun to match Apple\\'s software update policy, the Cupertino tech giant remains the most consistent and reliable, regardless of the model. (For reference, Samsung has a better track record updating its flagship phones than its mid-range phones.)\\nCons:\\n- Restrictive experience: Apple has loosened its grip on customizability over the years, with the latest iOS 18 update finally allowing users to freely place apps and widgets anywhere on the home screen grid. However, compared to Android, the iPhone software still has a ways to go. For example, you still can\\'t customize notification types at a per-app level, set navigation gestures beyond swiping from the left side to go back, or download third-party app icons.\\n- Poor file management: If you\\'ve ever downloaded an image from the web on an iPhone, you\\'ll know just how cumbersome it can be to locate that file later on. Sometimes, downloaded photos and videos will be directed into the file manager app first, requiring further action to fully migrate them into the Photos app.\\nFactors to consider when choosing a phone\\nThe process of making our phone selections includes real-world testing and researching about the phones for weeks, consulting with colleagues, industry experts, and analysts who also have hands-on experience with the smartphones, and then selecting the best from all of the available choices.\\nUltimately, we weigh in the following aspects when curating this list:\\n- Design: There\\'s only so much you can do with a slab design, but size differences, material choices, color options, and even the ability to bend a screen in half give shoppers enough diversity to have a preference. That\\'s why we have a recommendation for every form factor.\\n- Performance: For many, smartphones are the center of our lives, which means the best ones are performant and can handle most, if not all, tasks you throw at them.\\n- Camera: Arguably the most valuable feature of a smartphone; the consistency and reliability of a camera system can make or break the overall mobile experience. We test every device in broad daylight and in the darkest of nights when finalizing this list.\\n- Battery: Every option in this guide should last you at least a day of moderate use. We also consider what devices support fast charging and/or wireless charging.\\n- Value: Price points are noted, but the most important thing with buying a phone is getting your money\\'s worth. With these picks, you can rest assured that you\\'re getting the best bang for your buck.\\nHow we test phones\\nZDNET\\'s review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major phone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and special features. Here\\'s a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:\\n- Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users\\' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.\\n- Performance: Several factors affect a phone\\'s performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.\\n- Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.\\n- Battery life and charging: It\\'s also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).\\n- Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.\\n- Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.\\nFor a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.\\nKerry Wan\\'s smartphone advice\\nI\\'ve used dozens of smartphones in the past year alone, learning the ins and outs -- the tips and tricks -- to make the most out of my handset. Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone right now:\\nSpeeding up your smartphone\\nSomething I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access, but rules were meant to be broken, right?\\nTo turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From within, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from 1x (default) to .5x to double the speed of your phone\\'s animations.\\nOptimizing your battery health\\nTo preserve your phone\\'s battery life, it\\'s best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn (or degrade) the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn\\'t charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.\\nWhen in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone\\'s battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You\\'ll be amazed at how well it functions again.\\nHow to keep your phone clean\\nUnless you\\'re invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Apple Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it\\'s worth, if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at 1 meter deep.\\nOccasionally, take an alcohol pad and give your phone a wipe-down. If you think about it, your phone is just as likely to accumulate germs as your hands, so don\\'t forget to clean it, too.\\nFAQ on smartphones in 2025\\nWhen do new phones come out?\\nWhile the year just started, we can look at past industry trends to understand when new phones will be released. Below is a list of expected release dates/timeframe for major phones in 2025.\\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 series: January\\n- OnePlus 13 series: January\\n- Apple iPhone 16e: February\\n- Google Pixel 9a: March\\n- Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: July\\n- Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7: July\\n- Google Pixel 10 series: August\\n- Apple iPhone 17 series: September\\nWhich phone is best for money?\\nBesides the ones listed above, the OnePlus 13R is another great pick for the money. At $599, the device features a large 6.7-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate, a 50MP main camera system, a 6,000mAh battery that beats that of higher-cost devices, and 80W wired charging. The real kicker is OnePlus\\' aggressive trade-in offer, with the company discounting $100 when you turn in any phone in any condition, effectively bringing the 13R\\'s price down to $499.\\nWhich phone has the best camera?\\nWhether the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Google Pixel 9 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra are the best is debatable. For long-distance shots, Samsung\\'s 200MP rear camera with 100x Space Zoom can capture subjects as far out as the moon. Google\\'s Pixel phones have always been at the top for point-and-shoot pictures and a rather simplified (but effective) camera experience. If you\\'re a videographer at heart, then the iPhone 16 Pro Max, with the ability to record 4K videos at 120 frames per second and a new Camera Control button, is an excellent tool to get the shots you need.\\nHow long should a phone battery last?\\nThe average phone battery lasts about 22 hours on a full charge, which is great for staying connected on commutes, work flights, and evenings at home. But that\\'s just the average; actual use time varies by phone model, battery capacity, the power efficiency of its processor, and what you\\'re using your phone for.\\nFor example, the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max boasts a 32-hour battery life. But you\\'ll get less than that if you habitually scroll through social media or stream video and music.\\nHow much storage should my phone have?\\nMost smartphones have a base storage capacity of 128GB, which is plenty of space for average users to download apps and music, take photos, and shoot videos. However, if you\\'re a mobile or creative professional, you\\'ll need more space. Many smartphones have expanded storage options up to 512GB or even 1TB, and you can always sync your phone to your preferred cloud storage service to free up local storage space.\\nOther phones we tested\\nWhether you\\'re looking to upgrade or get your first smartphone, Apple, Samsung, and OnePlus have great choices that ZDNET\\'s tested and recommends.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Best phones 2025 tested â€” March top picks\\nWe\\'ve reviewed dozens of handsets to find the best phones at a wide range of prices\\nIt\\'s already shaping up to be a big year for the best phones, as one of the first major releases of 2025 has jumped to the top of our list. We think Samsung\\'s Galaxy S25 Ultra is the phone to beat right now, and it\\'s going to take some work for another device to pull that off.\\n1. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Best overall\\n2. iPhone 16 Pro Max: Best iPhone\\n3. Pixel 9 Pro: Smartest phone\\n4. Pixel 8a: Best under $500\\n5. OnePlus 13: Best Android flagship value\\n6. iPhone 16: Best iPhone value\\n7. Nothing Phone 3a Pro: Best alternative value\\n8. Galaxy S25: Most affordable Samsung flagship\\n9. OnePlus Open: Best foldable\\n10. iPhone 16e: Affordable AI\\nSamsung\\'s new premium device makes some key hardware improvements, chiefly an impressive new processor. But it\\'s AI that really puts the Galaxy S25 Ultra over the top, as many of the Galaxy AI addition to this year\\'s flagship put more power in the palm of your hand. And if you don\\'t want to pay $1,299 for your next phone, the Samsung Galaxy S25 offers those same AI features for less.\\nThat\\'s not to take away from our previous pick for the best phone, Apple\\'s iPhone 16 Pro Max. The top iPhone has outstanding cameras and epic battery life. It also offers AI tricks of its own via Apple Intelligence, and with Apple continuing to add more features via software update, the iPhone 16 Pro Max could soon find itself more closely competing with the Galaxy S25 Ultra\\'s AI capabilities.\\nIf you want to break out of the Samsung vs. Apple mindset, the Pixel 9 Pro and OnePlus 13 offer some strong alternatives. Bargain hunters will also appreciate the Pixel 8a for its rich Google AI features and well-rounded performance, but the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is stirring things up with its flagship level treatment at a mid-range cost. Meanwhile, if you\\'re looking for AI on the cheap, the iPhone 16e gives you a lower-cost way to enjoy all those new Apple Intelligence features.\\nI\\'ve reviewed many of these phones first-hand, with the rest of the phones team at Tom\\'s Guide adding their thoughts and insights for an in-depth look at which devices you should consider. Between every one of our phone reviewers, we\\'ve got more than four decades of experience evaluating phones from every possible angle.\\nOur best phone picks are based on our lab tests and real-world use of each phone we get our hands on. Here are the 10 phones you should consider if you\\'re looking to get a new handset right now.\\nI\\'m the managing editor for mobile at Tom\\'s Guide, where I\\'ve been working since 2015. In total, I\\'ve covered technology for 25 years now â€” I was even there when Steve Jobs showed off the original iPhone back in 2007. I\\'ve been looking at and testing phones since that day, and if you visit my Northern California home, you can marvel at the stacks of phones I keep handy for head-to-head testing.\\nThe best phone overall\\n1. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\\nWhy you can trust Tom\\'s Guide\\nSpecifications\\nReasons to buy\\nReasons to avoid\\nDon\\'t look for big hardware changes with the Galaxy S25 Ultra compared to last year\\'s model. instead, Samsung has put the focus on building out its Galaxy AI features to excellent effect. In fact, it\\'s fair to say, that mobile AI gets to the next level with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\\nThat\\'s because Samsung has added important features like cross app actions, where you can use the on-board digital assistant to interact with apps on your phone â€” both Samsung and Google apps, initially, along with Whatsapp and Spotify. Even better, you can give one command that triggers multiple actions, like looking up the date of an event, adding it to your calendar and texting the info to a friend.\\nA Personal Data Engine on board the phone learns your preferences, interests and activities and fills a new Now Brief screen with relevant information about upcoming appointments, weather forecasts or more. Now Brief is pretty bare bones at this point, but the promise is that it\\'s going to learn more about you over time and adjust its recommendations accordingly. We\\'ll circle back after using the Galaxy S25 Ultra to see if that\\'s true.\\nOther AI favorites like Circle to Search gain new powers and new features like the Now Bar serve as Samsung\\'s version of Live Activities on the iPhone, helping you track ongoing notifications from your lock-screen. None of this is to diminish the hardware changes that are present on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but AI takes the starring role here. And it\\'s quite a star turn at that.\\nPrice and value: If there\\'s one blemish to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it\\'s that the phone continues to cost more than rival flagships. At $1,299, this phone costs $100 more than the most expensive flagships from Apple and Google. But at least Samsung managed to avoid price increases this year, and the base model of the Galaxy S25 Ultra offers 256GB of storage. Galaxy S25 Ultra deals let you whack down the price of this phone a bit.\\nCamera performance: The biggest hardware change to the Galaxy S25 Ultra\\'s camera setup involves an upgraded ultrawide sensor â€” it\\'s now 50MP for more detailed shots and sharper macros. But upgrades to the ProVisual Engine that processes photos have paid off big for this year\\'s Galaxy devices, and the S25 Ultra reaps the rewards.\\nWhen my colleague Mark Spoonauer put the S25 Ultra up against the iPhone 16 Pro Max in an 11-round photo face-off, the Galaxy S25 Ultra wound up winning more rounds. In particular, Samsung\\'s phone excels at zooms, selfies and low-light shots. There are still some areas where the iPhone 16 Pro Max takes better shots, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra photo output has improved enough to make me conclude that this is the best camera phone you can buy right now.\\nBattery and charging: Samsung didn\\'t increase the battery size from the Galaxy S24 Ultra, but even so, this year\\'s model outlasted its predecessor on our battery test by 45 minutes. The Galaxy S25 Ultra was able to surf the web over cellular for 17 hours and 14 minutes, the longest time we\\'ve recorded for a Samsung device. Credit the Snapdragon 8 Elite inside the phone for improving power efficiency.\\nCharging speeds are unchanged from the previous few Ultra models, though Samsung has nominally added Qi2 wireless charging support. However, since the phone doesn\\'t feature magnets on its back for a more secure fit with Qi2 charging pads, you\\'re losing many of the benefits of the new charging standard unless you buy a Qi2-ready case.\\nOverall performance: The Snapdragon 8 Elite inside the Galaxy S25 Ultra does more than just help the new phone last longer on a charge. It also delivers some of the best performance we\\'ve seen on an Android device, especially since Samsung is using an overclocked version of the silicon. That helps the Galaxy S25 Ultra produce better benchmark numbers than the OnePlus 13, which also has a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. But the gaming-focused Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro can lay calim to the speed king title, thanks to its numbers on some tests.\\nThe neural engine on the Snapdragon 8 Elite coupled with 12GB of RAM on the base model give the Galaxy s25 Ultra enough processing muscle to handle more AI tasks on device. And the Galaxy S25 Ultra comes with a bigger, brighter display than last year\\'s model so everything from gaming to streaming looks better on this new device.\\nVerdict: The Galaxy S25 Ultra proves that big hardware changes aren\\'t necessary to make a splash in the smartphone world. The Galaxy AI features debuting on this year\\'s premium Samsung phone are reason enough to upgrade, especially if you\\'ve got an older phone. And the improved cameras, longer battery life and brighter screen add to the value, even if you find the Galaxy S25 Ultra\\'s high price a little hard to swallow.\\nRead the full review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\\n|---|---|---|\\nPrice | As great a phone as the Galaxy S25 Ultra is, $1,299 is a lot to pay for a handset, especially when you can get an iPhone 16 Pro Max or Galaxy 9 Pro XL for $100 less. | â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜† |\\nCameras | The camera competition between the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro is a tight one.

The Galaxy S25 Ultra excels in graphics testing and even beats the best iPhones in some CPU speed tests. A vapor chamber helps keep the phone cool | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… |\\nBattery life | The longest-lasting Samsung phone ever manages to outlast the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which was no slouch in the battery department, even with the same sized battery. Credit the Snapdragon 8 Elite for top power management features. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… |\\nMore on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\\nThe best iPhone\\nSpecifications\\nReasons to buy\\nReasons to avoid\\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max no longer holds down the top spot among the best phones we\\'ve tested, but that\\'s more of a reflection of the advanced AI on board the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It\\'s a situation Apple could soon address, as it continues its Apple Intelligence rollout in 2025, particularly if Siri gets its promised overhaul to be more contextually aware.\\nEven if Samsung now holds the edge, there\\'s plenty to love about the iPhone 16 Pro Max. This model offers a bigger screen (without increasing its overall size too much from the iPhone 15 Pro Max), an upgraded ultrawide camera and a faster processor. Even better, initial Apple Intelligence features are already available, with more to come.\\nYou won\\'t have to ditch your iPhone 15 Pro Max if you upgraded in 2023, and anyone worried about missing out on the first round of Apple Intelligence features should relax. While a good first step, Apple Intelligence is more of a nice-to-have than a must-have at this point. That said, there are plenty of compelling reasons to upgrade to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, particularly if you\\'ve got an iPhone that\\'s at least a couple years old.\\nPrice and value: While this model commands the same $1,199 cost as its predecessor, a larger 6.9-inch screen and bigger battery means you\\'re getting more for your money. That particularly true in light of the $100 price hike Samsung gave to the Galaxy S24 Ultra, which means Apple\\'s top device remains the less expensive option. \"Less expensive\" is relative, though, as the $1,199 starting price is a lot for some people to pay.\\nCamera performance: iPhones live and die by their cameras, and the telephoto lens on the iPhone 16 Pro Max offers some notable improvements to both its main camera and its ultrawide lens. These complement the 5x telephoto lens that returns from the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Because the iPhone 16 Pro features the same camera setup for $200 less, we rank that phone as the best camera phone overall, but you won\\'t be disappointed with what the iPhone 16 Pro Max cameras produce. We\\'ve even put it through a 200 photo face-off against the Galaxy S24 Ultra to crown an undisputed champion, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max came out on top on the strength of its superior dynamic range and low-light shooting capabilities. For now, the Galaxy S25 Ultra has regained the lead, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max remains an outstanding camera phone option.\\nBattery and charging: The battery on the iPhone 16 Pro Max lasts more than 17.5 hours on our battery test, where we have a phone surf the web until its battery gives out. The average phone barely makes it past 10 hours, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max was just getting warmed up at that point. No other iPhone has ever lasted that long, with the iPhone 16 Plus coming the closest with an average result of around 16.5 hours. If only the phone could charge quickly, but at least MagSafe charging is improved to 25W speed.\\nOverall performance: Qualcomm\\'s Snapdragon 8 Elite is giving the iPhone all it can handle, but the A18 Pro chipset powering the iPhone 16 Pro Max turns out to be a very fast chip on its own.. We noticed the extra oomph when using the iPhone 16 Pro Max to perform everyday tasks and switch between apps. When we used the iPhone 16 Pro Max to transcode a video, the task took half as long as it did on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and it bests the Galaxy S25 Ultra in that test, too.\\nVerdict: The iPhone 16 Pro Max wins top marks for design, photography and performance. Charging speed and digital zoom features could be further refined, and it\\'s very expensive relative to some of the other phones on this list, but you definitely get a lot of power and polish for your money.\\nRead the full review: iPhone 16 Pro Max\\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\\n|---|---|---|\\nPrice | This is the most expensive iPhone Apple sells. You can save $200 with the iPhone 16 Pro, if you don\\'t mind the smaller screen and less battery life. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† |\\nCameras | The iPhone 16 Pro Max is one of the best camera phones we\\'ve tested, though both the Pixel 9 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra beat it on zoomed shots. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nPower | Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-powered phones may have caught up to Apple\\'s silicon, but the A18 Pro continues to be a top performer, particularly when it comes to overall speed and daily tasks. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… |\\nBattery life | You won\\'t need to charge your phone up during the day.

Google\\'s an old hand at this, though, having switched to the AI-focused Tensor chipset with the Pixel 6. Now, we\\'re up to Tensor G4 on the Google Pixel 9 Pro, and having used Apple Intelligence, Galaxy AI and Google\\'s AI tools, I think Google has the most capable AI of them all. The Pixel 9 phones â€” including the 9 Pro â€” certainly had several of my favorite AI phone features introduced in the last year.\\nGoogle says customers wanted a more compact version of the Pro to go with the big-screen model. (If you prefer more screen real estate, consider the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which has the exact same features as the regular Pro, but a 6.7-inch display and bigger battery, instead. It\\'s also harder to use with one hand in my experience.)\\nPrice and Value: The Pixel 9 Pro costs the same $999 that Google charged for the Pixel 8 Pro. But that older phone had a larger screen, which makes me feel like I\\'m being asked to pay more for less phone. Then again, with the improvements to battery life and display brightness â€” not to mention the latest AI features â€” you can\\'t really claim that Google is shortchanging you on anything other than size.\\nCamera performance: Actual camera improvements are modest â€” a new ultrawide sensor adds a Macro mode that performed very well when I tried it out, though I think the iPhone 16\\'s macro photos are a little sharper. (They\\'re different phones, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max vs. Pixel 9 Pro XL photo face-off John Velasco did illustrates the superiority of Apple\\'s macro images.) As for the Pixel 9 Pro\\'s front camera, it gets an upgraded sensor, too, though I think Google needs to dial back the camera\\'s tendency to make faces look too smooth. Really, though, the Pixel 9 Pro\\'s camera performance lives on the strength of its photo processing, and that remains strong, the cameras producing well-composed shots that showed off fine details when I tested them.\\nBattery and charging: Battery life hasn\\'t been a strong suit for recent Google phones, but the Pixel 9 Pro breaks that losing streak. With a 4,700 mAh battery and a more efficient Tensor G4 chipset, the Pixel 9 Pro lasted an average of 13 hours and 30 minutes in our web surfing test â€” behind the comparably sized iPhone 16 and Galaxy S24 models, sure, but well, ahead of that 10-hour average for other smartphones. Other Pixels struggled to reach even that threshold so I like what I\\'ve seen from the Pixel 9 Pro\\'s ability to get through the day on a charge.\\nOverall performance: The Tensor G4 that powers the Pixel 9 Pro can\\'t keep pace with other top Android phones in benchmark testing, and it trails the iPhone 16, too. But that\\'s not the focus of Tensor. Instead, it powers a number of helpful AI features, including Pixel Screenshots for easy searches of content within screenshots, Add Me for inserting people into group shots and Call Notes for transcriptions and summaries of phone calls. Potentially, the best addition is Gemini Live, a smarter version of the Google Assistant. Pixel 9 Pro owners get a year of Gemini Advanced for supporting for complex features.\\nSome of the AI tools need some more polish, though they\\'re still further along than Apple Intelligence features at the moment. Right now Pixel Screenshots has been the most useful addition for me since I take a lot of screenshots to remember important details. Using Pixel Screenshots, I\\'m able to search for those images by their content, and the Pixel 9 Pro is smart enough to show relevant results. If you\\'re more into producing images from nothing, the Pixel Studio generative AI tool lets you create things with nothing more than text prompts.\\nVerdict: If you\\'re willing to bet that the Pixel 9 Pro\\'s AI features will improve over time, the camera performance, longer battery life and bright display should be enough to give you a great device right now.\\nRead the full review: Google Pixel 9 Pro\\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\\n|---|---|---|\\nPrice | On the bright side, the Pixel 9 Pro costs the same $999 as the Pixel 8 Pro. But you\\'re paying the same for a smaller screen. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† |\\nCameras | You\\'ll find few hardware changes outside an improved ultrawide sensor and higher-resolution selfie cam, but the Pixel 9 Pro still takes great shots. And the AI features are second to none. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nPower | The Tensor G4 enables a bunch of new AI-powered features that make the Pixel 9 Pro standout. But it badly lags behind Samsung and Apple phones in terms of speed. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† |\\nBattery life | We\\'ve finally got a series of Pixels that outlasts the average smartphone, with the Pixel 9 Pro beating the average result on our test by 3 hours. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nMore on the Google Pixel 9 Pro\\nBest under $500\\nSpecifications\\nReasons to buy\\nReasons to avoid\\nLike the Pixel 7a it replaced, Google\\'s Pixel 8a is the best phone to get when you refuse to spend more than $500, especially with the iPhone 16e emerging with a $599 price tag. With Google\\'s midrange Pixel, you\\'ll get one of the best camera phones for the price, along with the AI features found on current Pixel flagships. The only reason to pass on the Pixel 8a at this point is you\\'d prefer the more powerful Tensor G4 chipset and newer AI capabilities in the Pixel 9 series. Even so, the Pixel 8a remains a great option for bargain hunters who don\\'t want to pay the extra $300 you\\'d have to spend on a Pixel 9.\\nPrice and value: In addition to saving you money in the near term, the Pixel 8a can be a phone that you hold on to for a long time. Google offers seven years of software and security updates, matching the level of support the regular Pixel 8 phones get. With the Pixel 8a, Google is showing other phone makers how a midrange device should be. That said, Samsung does undercut the Pixel 8a\\'s price by $100 with its midrange model, the Galaxy A35, though the Pixel 8a enjoys some advantages when it comes to performance.\\nCamera performance: You\\'ll find the same cameras on the Pixel 8a as you did on 2023\\'s Pixel 7a, and photo processing capabilities work the same, too. While we wish there were more substantial improvements, you can\\'t knock the camera performance of the Pixel 8a, especially compared to other camera phones in this price range. For instance, in our 200-photo face-off between the Pixel 8a and Galaxy A35, Google\\'s phone really showed how it excels in photo processing and handling low-light images. People with the Pixel 7a won\\'t need to upgrade, but if you have an older midrange model, you\\'ll definitely see an uptick in photo quality with the Pixel 8a.\\nBattery and charging: Like the Pixel 9 Pro above, the Pixel 8a beats the average smartphone\\'s performance on our battery test, though less decisively. The Pixel 8a was able to surf the web for 11 hours and 21 minutes before running out of gas. To put that result in context, it\\'s an hour and 16 minutes longer than the Pixel 7a lasted. Wired charging speeds could be faster, low-price phone or no, but Google includes wireless charging on the Pixel 8a after adding it with the Pixel 7a.\\nOverall performance: As always, the story with Pixel phones centers around the AI features supported by the Tensor core on Google\\'s silicon. With a Tensor G3 running the show, the Pixel 8a matches the feature set found on Pixel 8 flagships, with Magic Editor and Best Take photo-editing features stealing the show. (The latter is particularly impressive, giving you the ability to edit group shots so that everyone is putting their best face forward.) But don\\'t sleep on the phone\\'s call management features, either, as I think they\\'re some of the best AI features on the Pixel and unique to Google\\'s phones. Forget about blazing speeds, though, as that\\'s not in the Tensor chips\\' locker. That said, the Pixel 8a does handily out-perform the Galaxy A35, which uses older Exynos silicon.\\nVerdict: The Pixel 8a is a worthy addition to the A series, with excellent cameras for a budget phone. With better battery life than before and extended software support, Google\\'s midrange phone is a even better bargain than its predecessor.\\nRead the full review: Google Pixel 8a\\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\\n|---|---|---|\\nPrice | Google kept its midrange phone under $500, making the Pixel 8a one of the better values you can find if you don\\'t want to pay flagship prices. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nCameras | The Pixel 9 cameras perform better than the Pixel 8a\\'s, but not so much that you\\'re sacrificing a great camera phone by paying less.

Whatever you want in a phone, the OnePlus 13 delivers it, from strong performance to a long-lasting battery. Even camera performance, long the Achilles heel of OnePlus phones, measures up well to top camera phones. Simply put, the OnePlus 13 delivers a complete package for less than what you\\'d pay for most flagships, even after a price hike\\nPrice and value: Let\\'s talk about that price hike. The OnePlus 13 starts at $899, which is $100 more than what the OnePlus 12 cost when it debuted. (You can knock that price down by trading in a phone when you buy the OnePlus 13 directly from the phone maker.)\\nIf you compare that to the starting price of entry-level flagships, it doesn\\'t reflect well on the OnePlus 13, though many of those $799 models have smaller displays than the 6.78-inch panel on OnePlus\\' phone. Compare it to similarly sized phones like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max, and the OnePlus 13 still costs substantially less while delivering equivalent features.\\nCamera performance: Teaming up with lens specialist Hasselblad continues to pay dividends for OnePlus, as the OnePlus 13 cameras perform better than anything we\\'ve seen from the phone maker. Testing produced photos that were very bright and colorful, and I\\'m particularly impressed with how the OnePlus 13 balances external light sources. Shots in low light turned out well, and the OnePlus 13 clearly has a knack for portrait shots, especially if your subject wears glasses. In some situations, photos shot by the OnePlus 13 can be a little too bright, robbing the final image of warmth and depth. But overall, I think the OnePlus 13 cameras hold up well against the competition.\\nBattery and charging: There\\'s not much to complain about here. A 6,000 mAh battery and the power management features found in the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset powering the OnePlus 13 produced the second-best result we\\'ve ever seen in our phone battery test. The new OnePlus flagship lasted 19 hours and 45 minutes, which is nearly 10 hours better than the average smartphone. Only the gaming-focused ROG Phone 9 Pro lasts longer on a charge.\\nYou won\\'t have to wait long to top off that battery either, thanks to 80W charging speeds in the U.S. (It\\'s 100W elsewhere.) With an 80W charger, we got the OnePlus 13 to a 92% charge in half-an-hour after draining its battery.\\nOverall performance: The top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset inside the OnePlus 13 means the phone can keep pace with just about any flagship, though we\\'ve heard that Samsung is optimizing the Snapdragon 8 Elite in its Galaxy S25 phones for better performance. Certainly, the performance-focused ROG Phone 9 Pro churns out better results than the OnePlus 13 with Qualcomm\\'s new chip, but that\\'s not stopping the OnePlus 13 from topping the latest iPhones in graphics testing as well as in some CPU tests.\\nJust as importantly, OnePlus doesn\\'t turn its back on AI features with this edition of its flagship. AI photo-editing tool take some of the guesswork out of removing blur and reflections from shots while an Intelligent Search tool makes it easier to find what you\\'re looking for on the phone.\\nVerdict: It\\'s time to start thinking about OnePlus in the same way you\\'d consider Samsung or Google when mulling over which Android phone to get. The OnePlus 13 belongs in the same conversation as any leading Android device, thanks to its strong performance, long-lasting battery and surprisingly strong cameras. Software support can\\'t quite match what those other phone makers offer, but overall, the OnePlus 13 gives you a top Android experience.\\nRead the full review: OnePlus 13\\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\\n|---|---|---|\\nPrice | You\\'ll pay more for the OnePlus 13 than you did for last year\\'s flagship. However, at $899, the OnePlus 13 still costs anywhere from $100 to $400 less than the premium big-screen phones it competes against. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† |\\nCameras | A Hasselblad partnership continues to pay dividends for OnePlus, as the OnePlus 13 cameras perform better than any of their predecessors.

This entry-level Apple flagship also offers incredible value against the pricier iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, thanks to all the things it has in common with those pricier models.\\nIn fact, my colleague John Velasco argues that the iPhone 16 is a Pro model in disguise, reversing the recent trend of Apple giving all its attention to the Pro phones. Certainly, no one would claim the iPhone 16 is an afterthought, given all the new additions.\\nPrice and value: The $799 starting price of the iPhone 16 remains a lot to pay for most people. But it\\'s cheaper than the $899 iPhone 16 Plus, not to mention those iPhone 16 Pro models., which start at $999 and only climb upward from there. Whether it\\'s the Galaxy S25 or Pixel 9, you\\'re going to pay $799 for an entry-level smartphone, so at least Apple\\'s not charging you more.\\nThe iPhone 16e costs $200 less and also supports Apple Intelligence features. But that phone comes with a single rear camera and lacks features like MagSafe support and the Dynamic Island. I think that\\'s an awful lot to give up unless price is absolutely paramount among your concerns.\\nCamera performance: The 48MP main camera unlocks a lot of photography potential in the iPhone 16, but its ultrawide camera gets an even better upgrade with a wider f/2.2 aperture that allows it to gather in more light than previous iPhones. That also enables a new macro mode on the iPhone 16, which produces more striking close-ups than I\\'ve seen from other phones.\\nThe iPhone 16 continues to offer lossless 2x zoom without the need of a telephoto camera too, which helps bridge the gap between itself and the Pro models. I\\'ve tested that feature against phones like the Galaxy S24 that have a dedicated zoom lens, and the iPhone holds its own when comparing 2x zooms. Zooming in further, though, will make the differences more apparent.\\nBattery and charging: Apple\\'s larger iPhones have more room for bigger batteries but the iPhone 16 still lasts more than 12 hours on a single charge â€” that\\'s well ahead of the average smartphone, but not the Galaxy S24. I remain frustrated by Apple\\'s 20W wired charging speeds, even after the company switched to USB connectivity with the iPhone 15. USB was supposed to be faster than Apple\\'s Lightning standard, so where\\'s the innovation? At least Apple improves wireless MagSafe charging to 25W.\\nOverall performance: The A18 chipset within the iPhone 16 is potent, proving just as capable as the A18 Pro. (Apple\\'s Pro chipset has a little more muscle when it comes to graphics, thanks to an extra core in its GPU.) Even more impressive is how it puts up better scores in GeekBench than most Android phones running the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. This boosted chipset allows the iPhone 16 to support AI-powered Apple Intelligence features just like Apple\\'s Pro models, though as we\\'ve noted it\\'s very early days for Apple Intelligence.\\nVerdict: The iPhone 16 is a better value than the iPhone 15 that came before it, thanks in part to its significantly longer battery life, stronger A18 performance, and how it now carries similar features found on the 16 Pro models â€” like Camera Control, Action Button, and support for spatial photos and videos. If you prefer a bigger screen and a longer-lasting battery, it may be worth an extra $100 for the iPhone 16 Plus, but Apple\\'s standard iPhone remains a compelling option in its own right.\\nRead the full review: iPhone 16\\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\\n|---|---|---|\\nPrice | Sporting the same $799 as before, the iPhone 16 is a better value than ever mainly because of how it has more in common with the Pro models than ever before. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nCameras | The 48MP main camera does a lot, but it still can\\'t beat a Pro iPhone due to the lack of a dedicated telephoto lens. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† |\\nPower | Apple uses a variant of its latest chipset, but the A18 manages to deliver outstanding results that narrows the gap against the A18 Pro. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† |\\nBattery life | As a compact phone, the iPhone 16 offers all-day battery. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nMore on the iPhone 16\\nBest alternative value phone\\nSpecifications\\nReasons to buy\\nReasons to avoid\\nBudget phones tend to have compromises, but the Nothing Phone 3a Pro offers more for less. Considering how it\\'s priced at $459 and packs features that are usually reserved for flagship models that easily cost double the amount, my colleague John Velasco says that the Nothing Phone 3a Pro redefines that it takes to be a budget phone.\\nWhile its strengths continue to be around its unique design, Nothing OS, and Glyph Interface, Nothing adds a robust set of triple cameras on the back of the phone â€” complete with a telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. Phones under $500 don\\'t get this sort of treatment with their cameras.\\nIf that\\'s not to convince you about its utility, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro also offers all-day battery life with its 5,000 mAh battery and fast charging with its 50W speed. Over on the software side, Nothing OS 3.1 sports the same minimalist design that the software is known for, while also diving into the world of AI with the Essential Space.\\nPrice and value: You really can\\'t beat its $459 starting cost, which is a fraction of the cost of your typical flagship. It\\'s also accompanied with 12GB of RAM and an even more generous 256GB of storage. Throw in its triple cameras, neat Glyph Interface, and long lasting battery, it\\'s hard to deny its value.\\nCamera performance: What\\'s clear here that budget phones can have triple camera systems. Yet the Nothing Phone 3a Pro takes it one step further because of how it consists of a main, ultrawide, and telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. The latter\\'s important because oftentimes budget phones have less optical zoom, or none at all because they\\'re transformed into portrait or macro cameras.\\nFor a budget phone, the camera performance is outstanding, especially under low light where it\\'s much improved over its predecessor in the Nothing Phone 2a. There\\'s also a dedicated macro mode than leverages the main camera instead of the ultrawide, to get sharper, more detailed images.\\nBattery life and charging: There\\'s a 5,000 mAh battery inside of the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, which is enough to propel it to an average of 14 hours and 33 minutes on Tom\\'s Guide\\'s battery benchmark test. That actually beats many of its main rivals, like the iPhone 16e and Pixel 8a.\\nYou can also tap into its 50W wired charging to get it charged in no time at all. In fact, 15 minutes of charging gets it up to 39% capacity â€” while 30 minutes moves it up to 70%. The only thing missing is wireless charging, which is probably the biggest compromise to getting this phone.\\nOverall performance: Ditching MediaTek in favor of Qualcomm this time around, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is powered by a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip. Benchmark scores don\\'t make it as formidable, but it can still handle everyday tasks. Beyond that, it struggles to keep up smooth frame rates with games, which can often come off as choppy even when its dedicated Game Mode is enabled.\\nVerdict: If you\\'re looking for a feature rich phone without the bloated cost, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro fits the bill. Few phones have such an intriguing design like this, plus it\\'s pared with a versatile triple camera system that covers all the range from near, far, and everything in between. You\\'ll just have to live without wireless charging and less than ideal gaming performance.\\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\\n|---|---|---|\\nPrice | For the amount it\\'s going for, the $459 almost feels criminal in this day and age because few phones are priced at this without being stripped away of features. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… |\\nCameras | Camera improvements on successive phones are often minor, but they\\'re night and day with the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. Not only does it get upgraded to a robust triple camera system, but the performance is better than expected for a value phone. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† |\\nPower | This is one of the biggest drawbacks about being a value phone because the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 isn\\'t equipped to handle intense graphics processing. | â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜† |\\nBattery life | The 5,000 mAh battery carries the phone for all-day use, while also outlasting its main rivals. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nBest Samsung flagship for most people\\nSpecifications\\nReasons to buy\\nReasons to avoid\\nAs with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AI improvements are the big draw for the Galaxy S25. Samsung once again offers the same Galaxy AI features across its flagship lineup, so anything the S25 Ultra can do, so can the standard S25.\\nConsidering the Galaxy S25 costs $500 less than Samsung\\'s premium device, this entry-level flagship will be the way most people experience the lastest AI features from Samsung. And if they wind up buying the Galaxy S25, they\\'ll be very pleased with the experience, despite some minimal hardware changes from previous additions.\\nPrice and value: That $799 starting price is what\\'s going to attract people to the Galaxy S25, especially if they balk at paying $1,000 and up for smartphones. If you find the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra too expensive, the Galaxy S25 provides a less expensive way to enjoy Samsung\\'s latest devices, especially since the AI features Samsung is emphasizing with this lineup are identical from phone to phone.\\nCamera performance: The Galaxy S25 uses the same camera setup found on the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S23, though the new phone does offer an update ProVisual Engine for better photo processing. Even with that change â€” which does have a very positive effect on the S25\\'s camera output â€” owners of recent Galaxy S models may not find much of a reason to upgrade on camera performance alone.\\nThat said, our camera testing revealed that the Galaxy S25 is less prone to over-saturating photos the way recent models did, so colors look a lot more natural in Galaxy S25 shots. Night shots also look livelier on the Galaxy S25 thanks to improvements aimed at low-light photography. The Galaxy S25 remains one of the few $799 phones to offer a telephoto lens, though the 3x optical zoom trails the 5x you\\'d get by paying up for Pro models from Apple or Google.\\nBattery life and charging: As Samsung\\'s most compact Galaxy S model, the entry-level version doesn\\'t have a lot of room inside for a big battery. To that end, the Galaxy S25 features a 4,000 mAh battery, just like its predecessor did. But that doesn\\'t stop the s25 from dramatically improving upon battery life.\\nWhen we had the Galaxy S25 surf the web continuously as part of our standard battery test, the new phone held out for 15 hours and 43 minutes, which almost 2.5 hours longer than the Galaxy S24\\'s battery test result. Clearly, the S25 is getting a lot of power management help from its Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, as that system-on-chip is supposed to offer better power management.\\nCharging speeds remain at a disappointing tepid 25W for wired charging. Like the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup, this standard version supports Qi2 wireless charging, though you\\'ll need a special case to take advantage of that support.\\nOverall performance: For the Galaxy S25, Samsung stopped using different chipsets for phones released in different regions like it did with the S24. Instead, everyone who buys a Galaxy S25 gets a Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered device â€” and that\\'s good news if you want the best performance in an Android phone.\\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite inside the S25 is optimized for Samsung\\'s phones, enabling the Galaxy S25 to pull ahead of the OnePlus 13 in CPU testing. (The two match up fairly well in graphics tests we\\'ve run.) And Samsung equips its entry-level flagships with a generous 12GB of RAM.\\nThat combination of chipset and memory also helps power the new Galaxy AI features, highlighted by the ability to perform actions across multiple apps via the phone\\'s digital assistant. The Now Brief feature the surfaces relevant information on your phone screen is promising, though we\\'ll not know how effective it truly is until it has time to learn from our actions and preferences.\\nVerdict: Not everyone cares for the Galaxy S25\\'s compact size, preferring a bigger screen on their device. However, if you like a phone that\\'s easy to use with one hand, and you want the very best Galaxy AI features without having to pay premium prices, the $799 Galaxy S25 delivers big value in its smaller size.\\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\\n|---|---|---|\\nPrice | The Galaxy S25\\'s $799 starting price matches similar offerings from Apple and Google. But the big difference is the $500 gap with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, even though those two Samsung phones share AI features. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nCameras | There\\'s no real change in hardware from recent Samsung models, so S24 and S23 owners may not feel compelled to upgrade. Photo processing improvements do make S25 photos look less saturated, though â€” a positive step. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† |\\nPower | Regardless of where you buy your Galaxy S25, you\\'ll get a phone powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite optimized for Samsung\\'s phones. That means the best Android performance available â€” once again for less than what Samsung\\'s pricier models cost. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nBattery life | No change in battery size? No problem. The Snapdragon 8 Elite\\'s power management features help the Galaxy S25 improve upon its predecessor\\'s time in our battery test by nearly 2.5 hours. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nMore on the Samsung Galaxy S25\\nBest foldable phone\\nSpecifications\\nReasons to buy\\nReasons to avoid\\nBoth the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold may have come out more recently, but the OnePlus Open still tops them both, especially now that it\\'s cheaper than Samsung\\'s top foldable. Not only is the OnePlus Open well made, but it offers up a more practical multitasking experience for users â€” easily the biggest argument we can make for choosing this phone over other foldables with a similar design.\\nThe OnePlus Open has everything power users crave, and the arrival of a variant called the OnePlus Open Apex Edition delivers storage enhancements and AI photo-editing tools. That will have to tide us over for now as OnePlus apparently won\\'t release a OnePlus Open 2 in 2025.\\nPrice and value: OnePlus has an attractive proposition for prospective buyers. It already undercuts other notebook styled foldables with its $1,699 starting cost, but the extra $200 trade-in credit offer effectively makes it $1,499, which is a much better deal than the $1,899 cost for the Galaxy Z Fold 6.\\nCamera performance: Armed with a Hasselblad camera system, the OnePlus Open handles most situations with ease, excelling mostly with its main camera when lightning conditions are ideal. Its 3x telephoto zoom camera is just as good as the Pixel Fold\\'s 5x zoom camera. That said, when John Velasco tested the OnePlus Open for Tom\\'s Guide, he found that the foldable\\'s cameras struggle in extreme low light conditions.\\nBattery and charging: Foldable phones don\\'t always last a long time on a charge, given the super-sized screens they have to keep powered. Yet, the OnePlus Open goes the distance lasting over 11 hours on our battery test â€” easily beating out the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold finished just a few minutes behind the OnePlus Open, so this is the foldable to get if you want a device that can stay powered up through the day. Like other OnePlus phones, the Open charges quickly, as we got the phone up to 85% capacity after 30 minutes.\\nOverall performance: Since the OnePlus Open is more than a year old, you\\'re getting a phone with an older chip. But as I noted with the OnePlus 12R, it\\'s not like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from 2023 is showing its age. Just be aware that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 can handle tasks faster, and even the Tensor G4-powered Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a bit more pep.\\nBut even if the OnePlus Open can\\'t out-muscle newer foldable phones, it still boasts the Open Canvas multitasking feature that John Velasco calls the best implementation of multitasking that he\\'s seen on all the foldable phones he\\'s reviewed for us.\\nVerdict: The OnePlus Open improves upon what existing notebook styled foldables have done already, but it includes all the necessary improvements to make it the best foldable phone. At the same time, it offers the longest battery life and fastest recharge speeds in a foldable, paired with a lower cost and premium design.\\nThat said, with no OnePlus Open update on the horizon, other foldable phone makers have the chance to close the gap with this current model. Keep an eye peeled for the likely Galaxy Z Fold 7 launch later this year to see if OnePlus Open rivals are up to the task.\\nRead the full review: OnePlus Open\\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\\n|---|---|---|\\nPrice | With other foldable phones going up in price, the OnePlus Open is the least expensive model you can find with a design that opens up like a book. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nDesign | The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is thinner, but the OnePlus Open is lighter and easier to tote around. | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† |\\nPower | While the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 was a strong chip in its day, the OnePlus Open is starting to fall behind rival foldables with newer silicon.

The iPhone 16e uses the same processor as the iPhone 16, meaning it can also support Apple Intelligence features, making it the lowest-cost iPhone to do so.\\nPrice and value: Itâ€™s a story of good news/bad news for the iPhone 16eâ€™s price. The good news is that the device is the cheapest iPhone Apple sells, starting at $599 for a 128GB model. Thatâ€™s $200 less than what youâ€™d pay for an iPhone 16, and you get the same Apple Intelligence features with the less expensive phone.\\nHowever, that $599 starting price is $179 more than what Apple was charging for the iPhone SE, so in a way, the cost of getting a brand new iPhone has gone up. If you want to find a silver lining, the 128GB of storage on board the 16e is double the capacity of the base model iPhone SE.\\nCamera performance: My colleague John Velasco compared the iPhone 16eâ€™s camera to the iPhone 16 and iPhone SE 2022 and came away impressed. The iPhone 16e may have just a single rear camera â€” a 48MP lens â€” but it uses photo-processing effectively to produce some very striking images with a lot of dynamic range and bold color (sometimes to the point over saturation).\\nIf youâ€™re familiar with the iPhone SEâ€™s camera, you know that it struggled to take detailed photos at night, but thatâ€™s not an issue with the iPhone 16e, which excelled at low-light photography in Johnâ€™s testing. Because of the 48MP sensor, the new iPhone can also approximate a 2x zooming, giving you greater flexibility, though not as much as you would enjoy with the iPhone 16 and its extra ultrawide lens.\\nBattery and charging: The iPhone 16e adopts a more modern design with a 6.7-inch OLED screen, compared to the 4.7-inch LCD panel on the iPhone SE (2022). Thatâ€™s relevant here, because the larger size gives Apple more room to squeeze in a big battery than the dinky power pack that led the iPhone SE to produce below-average results on our battery test. It also helps that the A!8 chipset inside the iPhone 16e excels at managing power efficiently.\\nThe end result is an average battery life that tops 12.5 hours on our test, improving on the iPhone SEâ€™s time by 3.5 hours and beating the average smartphoneâ€™s result by more than 2 hours. The iPhone 16e also finished ahead of the iPhone 16 when we tested those phones side-by-side, a result that might indicate the Apple-built C1 modem inside the iPhone 16e is as efficient as Apple claims. (Our battery test runs over cellular, so a modemâ€™s power efficiency would definitely have a hand in the result.)\\nOverall performance: The A18 chipset used by the iPhone 16e isnâ€™t quite the same as the one powering the iPhone 16 â€” this version has one less GPU core, which explains the lower scores on graphics benchmarks that John noticed when reviewing the phone. That said, the iPhone 16e handles graphically-intense games well, so youâ€™re not really sacrificing much in the way of performance with this phone the way you might with other midrange handsets.\\nThe true performance story is the iPhone 16eâ€™s support for Apple Intelligence features. Not only can you run the same AI tools available on more expensive models like the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Appleâ€™s ongoing updates will continue to build out the iPhone 16eâ€™s capabilities for some time to come.\\nVerdict: The iPhone 16e is not exactly a slam dunk,as you do give up some camera flexibility, MagSafe support and the Dynamic Island feature for a discounted phone thatâ€™s not as cheap as its predecessor. If you have the extra $200, the iPhone 16 is a better buy, but if cost is paramount, the iPhone 16e is a great way to experience Apple Intelligence for less.\\nAndroid users looking for less expensive AI have a lower-cost option of their own. The Galaxy S24 FE has many â€” though not all â€” of the Galaxy AI features found on Samsungâ€™s more expensive flagships and is worth checking out.\\nRead the full review: iPhone 16e\\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\\n|---|---|---|\\nPrice | The iPhone 16e offers a way to get Apple Intelligence for the lowest price.

However, iPhones offer speedier software updates, better games and apps and better security and privacy. See our iPhone vs Android face-off for more on the strengths and weaknesses of the two mobile platforms.\\nWhen do new phones come out?\\nIt helps to have some idea as to when new phones are on their way if for no other reason than you don\\'t unwittingly buy a device that\\'s about to be made obsolete. (There\\'s an argument to be made for buying a phone as its successor is getting announced should the older model see a price drop.) Phone makers tend to keep launch dates close to the vest, but they also have a habit of releasing new models at the same time of the year. Here\\'s out best guess as to what\\'s coming next for the most anticipated phones of 2025:\\n- Pixel 9a: Spring 2025\\n- Galaxy S25 Edge: April 2025\\n- Galaxy Z Fold 7/Galaxy Z Flip 7: Summer 2025\\n- Pixel 10: Fall 2025\\n- iPhone 17: Fall 2025\\nIs it better to buy an unlocked phone?\\nMost shoppers in the U.S. buy new phones through their wireless carrier. But an unlocked phone gives you the freedom to buy the device without any sort of contract and then bring it to the provider you want to use. And these days, it\\'s pretty easy to bring an unlocked phone to any phone carrier.\\nThat said, some phones cost more when you buy them unlocked. For example, Apple tacks $30 on to the price of the iPhone 16 for an unlocked model. Best Buy typically takes money off the price of a phone when you activate it with a specific carrier at time of purchase.\\nHow big of a phone should I get?\\nFans of the best small phones will have a hard time finding devices with screens smaller than 6 inches today, though a few still exist. Thanks to shrinking bezels, most phones with screens around 6.1 inches are fairly compact. If you prefer a big phone, you\\'ll want something with a screen that\\'s 6.5 to 6.8 inches. Anything bigger, and you\\'ll likely want to turn to a foldable phone, where the device opens up to reveal a larger display.\\nWhat should I consider when looking at camera features?\\nMost phones will come with at least two rear cameras â€” a main lens and an ultrawide shooter, usually. Telephoto lenses offering an optical zoom are often reserved for more expensive flagship phones. Don\\'t pay attention to the megapixel count. Instead, look at camera face-offs between phones to see the photo quality and look for special features like Night Mode to get better quality in low light. Also see our best camera phone roundup for more on the devices that really excel when taking photos.\\nWhat do I need to know about smartphone battery life?\\nGenerally, phones with larger batteries (measured in mAh) offer the longest battery life, but that\\'s not always the case. That\\'s why we run our own battery test, in which we make phones surf the web until they run out of power. The average phone runs out of juice in 10 hours in our test, while the best phone battery life we\\'ve tested tends to pass the 14-hour mark with some phones lasting longer than 18 hours.\\nWhat about AI features?\\nArtificial intelligence is the talk of the tech world these days, and mobile phones are looking to capitalize on the buzz by adding AI-powered features that either simplify common tasks or help you create new images and documents on the go.\\nGoogle\\'s phones â€” whether it\\'s the flagship Pixel 9 models or the budget Pixel 8a â€” have the most advanced AI, but Samsung has gotten very aggressive with adding Galaxy AI capabilities, whether it\\'s introducing AI features in new phones or extending those features to older flagships; that said, it\\'s unclear which Galaxy AI additions arriving with the Galaxy S25 will find their way to other Samsung devices.\\nApple trails both its rivals, though it hopes the Apple Intelligence features currently rolling out to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 Pro models will close the gap somewhat. The arrival of the iPhone 16e makes those AI features available in a lower-cost model.\\nHow we test smartphones\\nIn order for a smartphone to make our best phone list, it needs to excel on several tests that we run on every handset. We perform some of these tests in our labs and some in the real world.\\nWhen it comes to performance, we rely on such synthetic benchmarks as Geekbench 5 and 3DMark\\'s Wild Life Unlimited to measure graphics performance. These tests allow us to compare performance across iPhones and Android devices. We also run a real-world video transcoding test on each phone using the Adobe Premiere Rush app and time the result.\\nTo measure the quality of a phone\\'s display, we perform lab tests to determine the brightness of the panel (in nits), as well as how colorful each screen is (DCI-P3 color gamut). In these cases, higher numbers are better. We also measure color accuracy of each panel with a Delta-E rating, where lower numbers are better and score of 0 is perfect.\\nOne of the most important tests we run is the Tom\\'s Guide battery test. We run a web surfing test over 5G or 4G at 150 nits of screen brightness until the battery gives out. As noted above, a phone that lasts more than 10 hour has good battery life, while phones that last around 12 hours or longer are among the longest-lasting phones we\\'ve tested.\\nLast but not least, we take the best phones out in the field to take photos outdoors, indoors and at night in low light to see how they perform versus their closest competitors. We take shots of landscapes, food, portraits and more, and also allow you to be the judge with side-by-side comparisons in our reviews.\\nFor more information, check out our how we test page for Tom\\'s Guide.\\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom\\'s Guide direct to your inbox.\\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\\nPhilip Michaels is a Managing Editor at Tom\\'s Guide.

Learn more\\nIt\\'s hard to go wrong with most phones in the US today, and it\\'s almost impossible to find a bad premium phone in 2025. Considering that, the \"best phone\" depends on your budget and priorities. Still, we can make a general assessment of the best phone overall.\\nAmong the best phones available now, Apple\\'s iPhone 16 is our top option for most people due to its balance of performance, camera quality, camera reliability, battery life, and ecosystem for the price. Samsung\\'s Galaxy S25 is ideal for Android users for most of the same reasons as the iPhone 16.\\nOn the more affordable end of the spectrum, Apple\\'s iPhone 14 and Google\\'s Pixel 8a are superb devices that offer incredible value. These aren\\'t exactly \"cheap,\" but we think they\\'re well worth the price considering their long-lasting performance, camera quality, and other premium features.\\nOur top picks for the best phones\\nBest overall: iPhone 16 - See at Verizon\\nBest phone for Android users: Samsung Galaxy S25 - See at Samsung\\nBest budget iPhone: iPhone 14 - See at Verizon\\nBest budget phone for Android users: Google Pixel 8a - See at Amazon\\nBest camera phone: iPhone 16 Pro - See at Verizon\\nBest battery life: iPhone 16 Pro Max - See at Verizon\\nBest foldable phone: Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold - See at Amazon\\nBest overall\\nApple\\'s latest standard flagship phone, the iPhone 16, runs Apple Intelligence and boasts some hardware upgrades over the iPhone 15, like the useful Action and Camera Control buttons and a new-generation processor.\\n- \\'Pro\\' features like the Camera Control and Action buttons\\n- Runs Apple Intelligence on a new-generation processor\\n- Redesigned and improved camera system\\n- Stronger Ceramic Shield display with new-low brightness\\n- Outdated 60Hz display\\n- Lacks a dedicated optical zoom lens\\n- Some Apple Intelligence features have room for improvement\\nThese days, most smartphone users fall into either Team iPhone or Team Android. If you\\'re platform agnostic and want a phone that requires the fewest compromises, we recommend the iPhone 16. (Our best iPhone guide shows what else we recommend for those who prefer Apple.)\\niPhones have stayed relatively consistent year over year, and Apple has largely stuck to a successful playbook for the iPhone 16: A phone that delivers a great user experience that revolves around a stable and familiar operating system, best-in-class camera system, and popular apps.\\nThe iPhone 16 includes several noteworthy upgrades over the iPhone 15, which was already a substantial upgrade over the iPhone 14. Its new A18 processor is incredibly powerful, and the phone incorporates the Action button that was previously an iPhone Pro model exclusive. It also features the new Camera Control button and a refreshed camera design, which houses an improved ultrawide camera that now takes macro photos.\\nThe biggest \"new thing\" about the iPhone 16 is support for Apple Intelligence AI features. In our testing of Apple Intelligence\\'s initial iterations, we\\'ve found the AI promising, especially since iOS 18.2\\'s ChatGPT integration and new features like the AI-generated Genmoji. Apple continued to refine its existing Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18.3, like enhancements to notification summaries and added capabilities for Visual Intelligence. However, the suite could still use polishing and expansion.\\nWhile the newest Android phones aren\\'t anything to sneeze at, we still recommend the iPhone for most people due to the polished hardware and software, ease of use, an unmatched ecosystem of devices, and Apple\\'s physical retail presence to get support.\\nThose who could use Apple\\'s latest high-end features should consider the iPhone 16 Pro models, which exclusively offer absurdly powerful A18 Pro processors, new larger displays, pro-level video recording options, dedicated zoom lenses, and faster USB 3 data transfers. They also feature premium 120Hz ProMotion displays, which Apple has continuously denied to its base iPhone models, including the iPhone 16.\\nRead our full iPhone 16 review, and see our guide to the best iPhone 16 cases to protect the phone.\\nBest phone for Android users\\nThe Galaxy S25\\'s biggest updates include an incredibly powerful new processor and new AI features. Battery life is slightly improved, but the design, display, and cameras are largely unchanged from the previous generation.\\n- Elite performance for its price\\n- Useful new AI features\\n- Stellar battery for its size\\n- Slower charging speed relative to series siblings\\n- Facial recognition still presents issues\\nWith its triple-lens camera, class-leading performance, AI features, and excellent battery life, the Samsung Galaxy S25 is the complete package. No other current, comparably priced phone offers as much from a specs standpoint as the Galaxy S25, even among iPhones.\\nIndeed, the Galaxy S25\\'s three cameras set it apart from other Android phones in its 6.2-inch size range and $800 price range. By including a 3x zoom lens, the Galaxy S25 offers a more versatile camera experience, allowing you to take better-quality photos of subjects further away.\\nBattery life is also excellent, though we would have preferred that its 25W charging speed was upgraded to 45W to match the rest of the Galaxy S25 series.\\nOverall, the Galaxy S25 is our top pick among the best Android phones. Its stellar performance and high-end features, at a reasonable price point, are likely to satisfy most people specifically looking for an Android phone.\\nFor those who prefer larger displays, the Galaxy S25 Plus with a 6.7-inch display is the clear option. It\\'s basically a larger version of the base Galaxy S25 with 45W charging speed.\\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review, and see our guide to the best Samsung Galaxy S25 cases to protect the phone.\\nBest budget iPhone\\nThe iPhone 14 could be a worthy choice for people upgrading from the iPhone 11 or older. It\\'s the only current \"budget\" option somewhat comparable to the iPhone 16 as a standard iPhone.\\n- Newly discounted price\\n- Emergency safety features\\n- Still-smooth performance\\n- Lacks Action and Camera Control buttons\\n- Lacks Dynamic Island\\n- Not compatible with Apple Intelligence\\nIf you\\'re looking for the best iPhone experience for the lowest price, go for the iPhone 14 rather than the iPhone SE (2022). Yes, the iPhone 14 has a $599 starting price, which stretches the definition of \"budget\" compared to the iPhone SE\\'s $429 starting price. However, we feel the iPhone 14\\'s extras are well worth it.\\nThe iPhone 14 runs on Apple\\'s A15 Bionic processor (the same as the iPhone SE, coincidentally). Although three generations old, we took it for a test drive after the latest iOS 18 update and found it can still easily handle any app or game in the App Store, except for AAA games that are exclusive to iPhones with certain processors, like the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 series.\\nThe iPhone 14 also features Apple\\'s modern design rather than the iPhone SE\\'s antiquated look with its top and bottom bezels. It also includes Face ID, a larger 6.1-inch OLED display, a dual-lens camera, and support for Apple\\'s MagSafe wireless charging and accessories. To top it all off, the iPhone 14 has significantly better battery life than the iPhone SE.\\nWith all this in mind, we think you\\'ll better enjoy the experience with the iPhone 14 for the years you\\'ll use it. Based on Apple\\'s support cycle, we\\'d estimate Apple will support the iPhone 14 for another four generations.\\nHowever, if budget matters more than features and design, you\\'ll still be happy with the iPhone SE (2022), as it remains another top option among the best cheap phones available. But be aware that the iPhone SE uses an outdated design with a small screen and Touch ID, and Apple is expected to release a new version of the phone soon.\\nRead our full iPhone 14 review.\\nBest budget phone for Android users\\nThe Pixel 8a is nominally a budget version of the Pixel 8, but you\\'d have a hard time telling them apart. The Pixel 8a dominates in its price range and comes easily recommended thanks to its stellar value relative to its performance, camera quality, and high-end display.\\n- Incredible value\\n- Great performance to price ratio\\n- Smooth 120Hz OLED display\\n- Stellar cameras\\n- Slow 18W charging\\n- Outdated Pixel design\\nStarting at $499, Google\\'s Pixel 8a offers the best bang for your buck for Android users. No doubt, you can easily find Android phones with price tags around $200, but if you\\'re at all discerning with a budget to spend, you won\\'t regret going for the Pixel 8a.\\nMost importantly, you won\\'t feel the need to buy another phone for a long time thanks to the Pixel 8a\\'s fast and smooth performance, coupled with its seven-year support window (until May 2031) for Android upgrades and security updates. The Pixel 8a runs on the Google Tensor G3 processor, so performance is on par with the previous flagship Pixel 8 models, which run the same processor.\\nCombine the Pixel 8a\\'s performance with its smooth 120Hz display and 1080p resolution, and the experience is nothing short of premium. It\\'s an OLED panel with superior colors, brightness, and contrast than any LCD or LED display, and it includes a high-end always-on display feature.\\nThe Pixel 8a\\'s cameras also compete with phones that cost twice as much. Even sub-par cameras on less expensive Android phones serve their purpose of capturing memories, but the Pixel 8a\\'s premium-quality cameras simply do it better, especially in reliability and versatility. The Pixel 8a (like any of the best Google Pixel phones) doesn\\'t need ideal conditions and perfectly steady hands to take good, clear, focused photos.\\nThe Pixel 8a is also just a good-looking phone with its frosted matte-texture plastic back and eye-catching color options.\\nOur only complaint with the Pixel 8a is its relatively slow 18W charging, but it does feature 7.5W wireless charging. That\\'s also slow, but it\\'s still a nice option for all-day desk charging, and it\\'s not one you\\'ll usually find on budget-friendly Android phones. We would also have liked to see an option with a larger display, but that would surely mean a higher price.\\nIf you aren\\'t looking to take advantage of carrier deals (and potentially get locked into a long-term contract) to get a higher-end phone for free or at a significant discount, you can\\'t go wrong with the Pixel 8a, the best budget Android phone on the market.\\nRead our full Google Pixel 8a review, and see our guide to the best Google Pixel 8a cases to protect the phone.\\nBest camera phone\\nThe iPhone 16 Pro\\'s upgraded camera system matches its Pro Max sibling with a 5x optical zoom lens for the first time. Other upgrades include a larger, 6.3-inch display, slow-motion 4K video recording at up to 120 fps, and new studio-quality microphones.\\n- Unrivaled three-camera system with 5x optical zoom\\n- Pro and Pro Max models offer the same cameras\\n- Top-tier, pro-level video recording options\\n- Camera Control button is unique and convenient\\n- Initial Apple Intelligence suite is in need of expansion and refinement\\nThe three-camera system on Apple\\'s iPhone 16 Pro models outperforms all competitors with its consistency, versatility, and collection of high-end features.\\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is the first base iPhone Pro model with an identical camera system to the contemporary Pro Max model, so there\\'s no camera-related upgrade in opting for the larger and more expensive phone. Both models now include a 5x optical zoom lens, whereas previous Pro models had a 3x zoom.\\nThe iPhone 16 Pro also features Apple\\'s useful new Camera Control button for quickly accessing and adjusting photo and video capture in the camera app; no high-end Android phone in the US has a similar feature. Another point of separation from most Android competitors is the iPhone 16 Pro\\'s new and expansive suite of advanced features, including Dolby Vision 4K video recording at up to 120 frames per second (fps), support for LOG video recording, ProRAW photos, ProRES video encoding, and a studio-quality four-microphone system.\\nFor those not interested in Apple\\'s phones or ecosystem, our top camera pick among the best Android phones is the Google Pixel 9 Pro. Its three lenses offer plenty of versatility (including a 5x zoom lens) and consistently produce natural colors and depth that outclass any of the best Samsung phones.\\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro review, and see our guide to the best iPhone 16 Pro cases to protect the phone.\\nBest battery life\\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max\\'s year-over-year upgrades include a larger, 6.9-inch display, upgraded cameras, the powerful A18 Pro processor, and industry-leading battery life.\\n- Best battery life of any phone we\\'ve tested\\n- New larger display size\\n- Incredibly powerful A18 Pro processor\\n- New Camera Control button can be handy\\n- Stronger Ceramic Shield display glass with new-low brightness\\n- Separate fast USB-C cable needed for USB 3 transfer speeds\\n- No improvements to wired charging speed\\nApple claimed the iPhone 16 Pro Max offered the longest battery life of any iPhone to date at its launch. Our testing corroborated the claim, as the iPhone 16 Pro Max finished our intensive battery test with a 74% charge remaining, the best result we\\'ve seen from any iPhone or Android phone.\\nWith its large battery, afforded by a huge 6.9-inch display size, the iPhone 16 Pro Max gives you the best chance of any phone to last two days on a single charge (depending on usage).\\nIf you\\'re looking for the best battery life in a base model iPhone for a less expensive option than the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 15 Plus remain available and are still top performers (both achieved a 73% result). The iPhone 16 Plus surprisingly scored a lower 70% in our tests, but it\\'s still a superb result.\\nAmong the best Android phones for battery life, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL offered the longest battery life in our testing with a 70% result, followed by Samsung\\'s Galaxy S25 Ultra with 64%.\\nOur battery tests include a simulated mix of light and heavy usage with three hours of screen-on time. We put every phone we test through a two-hour video stream, two runs on the intensive 3D Mark Wild Life Stress Test, five runs of the Geekbench 6 CPU test, and one hour of music streaming while connected to a Bluetooth speaker. See our guide to the best phone battery life for more information.\\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro Max review, and see our guide to the best iPhone 16 Pro Max cases to protect the phone.\\nBest foldable phone\\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold\\'s 6.3-inch exterior display is the same shape and size as the Pixel 9 Pro, making it familiar and comfortable to use as a simple phone. Unfolding it reveals an eight-inch tablet, which is among the biggest you can find in a foldable phone.\\n- Vastly improved design from Google\\'s first foldable\\n- Powerful, generally useful AI features\\n- Exterior display feels and operates like a normal phone\\n- Superb cameras include 5x zoom lens\\n- Large 8-inch interior tablet display\\n- Some AI features can deliver questionable results\\n- Lacks dust resistance\\n- Cost prohibitive\\nWe prefer book-style foldable phones that unfold into compact tablets for their superior functionality and performance relative to clamshell foldables, which fold into compact squares.\\nAmong the current phone-tablet hybrid foldables available in the US, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is our favorite option for its premium build, large 9-inch tablet display, regular phone-style 6.3-inch cover display, performance, and cameras. It tops the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, mostly due to Samsung\\'s awkwardly narrow cover display.\\nAll phone-tablet hybrid foldables essentially offer the same level of performance, top-of-the-line displays with premium specs, like 120HZ refresh rates and OLED panels, excellent camera quality, and superlative battery life.\\nWhat sets the Pixel 9 Pro Fold apart among the best foldable phones is its eight-inch tablet display, the biggest available in a foldable in the US. It\\'s also the thinnest hybrid foldable, and its thinness is especially noticeable in tablet mode.\\nOur only gripe with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is its slow wired and wireless charging speed compared to the rest of the Pixel 9 series.\\nWe still love the OnePlus Open for the same reasons we love the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, but it\\'s more than a year old, and its previous-generation processor offers less long-term value.\\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review, and see our guide to the best Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold cases to protect the phone.\\nWhich is the best phone to buy right now?\\nOverall, Apple\\'s iPhone 16 is the phone we\\'d recommend to most people, at least those who live in the US. Android phones these days are fantastic, but they still lack certain key features, like advanced biometric authentication that\\'s on par with Apple\\'s Face ID. Even minor features, like Apple\\'s Dynamic Island, make us lean toward the iPhone 16, and no Android phone maker can match Apple\\'s physical retail presence, which is invaluable to receiving support.\\n| Specs | iPhone 16 | Samsung Galaxy S25 | iPhone 14 | Google Pixel 8a | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max | Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold |\\n| Starting price | $799 | $799.99 | $599 | $499 | $999 | $1,199 | $1,799 |\\n| Processor | Apple A18 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Optimized for Galaxy | Apple A15 Bionic | Google Tensor G3 | Apple A18 Pro | Apple A18 Pro | Google Tensor G4 |\\n| Release date | September 2024 | February 2025 | September 2022 | May 2024 | September 2024 | September 2024 | August 2024 |\\n| Screen size | 6.1 inches | 6.2 inches | 6.1 inches | 6.1 inches | 6.3 inches | 6.9 inches | 8-inch interior; 6.3-inch exterior |\\n| Rear cameras | 48MP main, 12MP ultrawide | 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP 3x zoom | 12MP main, 12MP ultrawide | 64MP main, 13MP ultrawide | 48MP main, 48MP ultrawide, 12MP 5x zoom | 48MP main, 48MP ultrawide, 12MP 5x zoom | 48MP main, 10.5MP ultrawide, 10.8MP 5x zoom |\\n| Storage | 128GB, 256GB | 128GB, 256GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 256GB, 512GB |\\nHow we test phones\\nWe test iPhones and Android phones as if they were our daily drivers for at least a week, often longer, to get a feel for their performance, battery life, cameras, and new features. We have extensive experience testing various phone models from different companies at various price points, which lets us quickly identify any issues.\\nIn addition to real-world usage, we conduct standardized tests on all phones reviewed and included in our guides.\\nFor performance, we put phones through a series of benchmarking apps to check for discrepancies between devices. We use Geekbench 6 for general performance and the 3DMark Wild Life Stress Test to gauge extended heavy gaming performance. These tests help us estimate how long a phone could maintain its performance relative to comparable phones.\\nFor camera testing, we photograph a consistent set of scenes with every phone and compare the results with their direct competitors. We take photos and videos with each lens on each phone and evaluate the differences. We also assess our own personal photos taken with each phone. We even compare budget camera phones to premium options to evaluate the image and video quality discrepancies.\\nFor battery life, we run phones through a stress test that simulates a range of typical daily workloads, like streaming video and music, and high-intensity activities, like playing demanding games. This test includes five runs of the Geekbench 6 app, two runs of the 3DMark Wildlife Stress Test, two hours of video streaming at a set average brightness, and one hour of music streaming with a Bluetooth speaker connected. The tests accumulate to three hours of screen-on time. At the end of the test, we note the phone\\'s remaining battery percentage.\\nFAQs\\nHow much storage should a phone have?\\nThese days, 128GB is the standard minimum storage option on most phones. Anything lower than that, like 64GB, can be quite limiting in terms of how many apps you can install, and you can basically forget about storing a significant number of photos, videos, and music.\\n128GB of storage can be enough, especially if you use cloud storage for photos and often stream videos and music. Depending on how many apps you use, you can also get by downloading videos and music for flights.\\nYou should opt for more than 128GB of storage if you tend to download your music rather than stream it or store lots of photos and videos on your phone. More storage can be helpful if you have many apps and games.\\nHow long should a phone\\'s battery life last?\\nA phone\\'s battery should last you through a typical day, even for heavy users with extensive screen time. Thankfully, most phones tend to have good enough battery life to do so.\\nLarger phones tend to have longer battery lives than smaller ones, so users with lots of screen-on time would benefit from a larger phone if not for the larger display.\\nAs detailed in our guide to the best phone battery life, the best option for a phone that can last longer than a day routinely is Apple\\'s iPhone 16 Pro Max. Android users with high battery requirements should go for the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.\\nWhat is a good camera for a phone?\\nMore than anything, a good phone camera should give you confidence that you\\'ll get a high-quality photo or video without making you feel like you need to check and retake your content.\\nIn this regard, we tend to trust Apple\\'s iPhones and Google\\'s Pixel phones the most. Correspondingly, our top overall picks for phone camera systems are Apple\\'s iPhone 16 Pro and Google\\'s Pixel 9 Pro, which both offer a dedicated 5x zoom lens.\\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.
